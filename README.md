### img2url

Upload an image and instantly redirect to URL if available. Tired of people sending you screenshots of URLs? Now you have a solution! Other use cases may include when they handwrite you a URL, you took a picture of a URL, or you are screenshotting from a YouTube video. 

Also serves as a general purpose text extraction tool. Built on top of Tesseract.


#### Todo List
- [ ] Improve security, I see similar sites use Cloudflare (what for?)
- [ ] Improve UI, make it look nice
- [ ] Improve accuracy of the OCR (uses Tesseract atm)
