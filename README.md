### img2url

Paste or upload and image, instantly redirect to URL if available. I built this because I got tired of people sending me screenshots of their URLs ðŸ˜­. Other use cases may include when they handwrite you a URL, you took a picture of a URL, or you are screenshotting from a YouTube video.


#### Todo List
- [ ] Improve security, I see similar sites use Cloudflare (what for?)
- [ ] Improve UI, make it look nice
- [ ] Improve accuracy of the OCR (uses Tesseract atm)
